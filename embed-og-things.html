        Hey. You might want to know about... <a href="https://ogp.me/" target="_blank">OpenGraph</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        Why? Well, because that's how social media, search engines, chat apps, and other things "know" what's in your site. 
        So they can generate a preview!

    <p>
        But is that really what's in your site? Hmmm. Perhaps an experiment is in order.

         in your favorite chat, social media, or.... thing that shows previews of websites ;)
